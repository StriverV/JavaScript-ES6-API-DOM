API =  API (Application Programming Interface)
      A way for two programs 
      to communicate with each other.
      -You send a request
      -You get a response


API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It is a bridge that allows two applications or systems to talk to each other.


API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
In the context of APIs, the word
 Application -> refers to any software with a distinct function. 
 Interface   -> can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications.


 Imagine you're at a restaurant:
You (the user) want food.
The menu is the API — it shows what you can ask for.
The waiter takes your order (request) to the kitchen (server) and brings back the food (response).
So, the waiter (API) is the middleman between you and the kitchen.

-----
You want to get weather data in your app.
Instead of collecting all weather info yourself, you can use an API from a service like OpenWeather.

You send a request:
https://api.weather.com/data?city=Dhaka

The API sends a response:

{
  "temperature": "30°C",
  "condition": "Rainy"
}


How does an API work?
Client sends a request (like a browser or mobile app)
Server processes the request and sends back a response
Client uses the response data
