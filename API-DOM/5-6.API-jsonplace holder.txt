✅ What is an API?

* API = *Application Programming Interface*
* It lets two programs talk.
* You send a **request**, and you get a **response** (usually in JSON format).

---

✅ Real-life Example:

* Like ordering food at a restaurant.

  * You → request food.
  * Waiter → sends request to kitchen.
  * Kitchen → makes food.
  * Waiter → brings back your food (response).

✅ What is `fetch()`?

* It's a JavaScript function to **get data from an API**.
* Used a lot in real-world apps (like weather, user profiles, Google login, etc.).

✅ How fetch() works (step-by-step):

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
  .then(res => res.json())       // Converts response to JSON
  .then(data => console.log(data))  // Shows the actual data
  .catch(error => console.error(error))  // Catches errors
```

### ✅ JSON = JavaScript Object Notation

* A format to send/receive data.
* Looks like this:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Leanne Graham" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Ervin Howell" }
]

### ✅ Loop through JSON


for (let user of data) {
   console.log(user.name);
}
